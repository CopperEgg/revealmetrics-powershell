revealmetrics-powershell
=============

The CopperEgg Powershell module is a Powershell interface to the CopperEgg API, making it simple to create custom metrics and dashboards for Microsoft Windows systems.

##Synopsis
The module includes:
  - CopperEgg.psm1... contains Powershell functions that are wrappers for the CopperEgg API
  - Initialize-MetricGroups ... creates metric groups, and sends them to CopperEgg
  - Initialize-Dashboards ... creates custom dashboards, and sends them to CopperEgg
  - Start-CopperEggMonitor ... starts one or more background jobs that periodicaly transmit your metrics to CopperEgg
  - and other utilities.

This module provides a 'Works-Out-of-the-Box' set of default metrics and dashboards for
  - MSSQL
  - .NET CLR
  - ASP.NET
  - IIS
  - and a variety of system-level Microsoft performance counters.

The module was created in response to customer requests for Powershell sample code using the CopperEgg API.

## Recent Updates:  
version 0.9.2 
Fixed the uncommented-comment in win_ctrs.txt, and updated CopperEgg.psm1 to fix a problem when sending metrics.

version 0.9.1
This release includes the capability to create user-defined metrics ... metrics that you create to monitor your application or infrastructure.
A sample dashboard and two metrics are provided to get you started by monitoring any of your background tasks, and their return codes. Check out
win_counters.txt, and the UserDefined.psm1 module for more info!

## Requirements
This release requires Powershell v3.0, which ships with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.
It has also been tested on Windows Server 2008r2 and Windows 7, with Powershell v3.0 installed.

You can download Powershell v3.0 here:
* [Microsoft Powershell v3.0](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34595)

A CopperEgg account is also required. If you don't have one yet, check it out:
* [CopperEgg Corporation](http://copperegg.com)

## Installation

* Clone this repository.

```ruby
git clone git://github.com/CopperEgg/revealmetrics-powershell.git
```
* Copy the CopperEgg-powershell.zip to the system you want to monitor. Before unzipping the archive, Right-click on Properties, and 'Unblock' the archive.

* Start Windows Powershell, running as Administrator

* Set the ExecutionPolicy to RemoteSigned (if you haven't already):

```ruby
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
* Create the installation directory, and cd to that directory:

```ruby
New-Item 'c:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\CopperEgg' -type directory
cd 'c:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\CopperEgg'
```
* Create a Powershell profile. If you have already set up a Powershell profile, skip this step.

There are a number of different profiles used by Powershell and PowershellISE, and they are in different places. :(
To see the choices, enter the following:

```ruby
$PROFILE | Format-List * -Force
```
The following instructions assume that you will create and edit the AllUsersAllHosts profile:

```ruby
new-item $PROFILE.AllUsersAllHosts -ItemType file -Force
```
* Edit your powershell profile to include a path to the CopperEgg module directory. Add the following line to your powershell profile:

```ruby
Set-Location "c:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\CopperEgg"
$env:PSModulePath = $env:PSModulePath + ";c:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\CopperEgg\"
```

* Unzip the CopperEgg-powershell.zip file to "c:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\CopperEgg".

* Edit the CopperEgg_APIKEY.txt file, and replace the text therein with your CopperEgg API key, which you will find in the CopperEgg UI, under Settings.
Save the file, and close it.

## Usage

####Load the CopperEgg module:

```ruby
import-module .\CopperEgg.psd1
```
####Initialize the default metric groups and dashboards:
```ruby
Initialize-MetricGroups
Initialize-Dashboards
```
####Start monitoring:

```ruby
Start-CopperEggMonitor
```
The module will set up a number of background jobs. You can continue to use your powershell UI, and the monitoring will continue.
Now go have a look at your CopperEgg UI, and you will see your new dashboards up and running!

####To stop monitoring:
```ruby
Stop-CopperEggMonitor
```

####To remove all loaded CopperEgg modules:
```ruby
Remove-AllCopperEgg
```

##Next Steps

The metrics monitored are selected using the win_counters.txt file. You will find notes there about the formatting, and additional detail will be found in Initialize-MetricGroups.ps1
The dashboards are built in Initialize-Dashboards.ps1. Use that code as a starting point for creating views exactly as you want them.


##To Run Your CopperEgg-StartMonitor.ps1 script 'as a service'

Specifically, these instructions are for ensuring that your monitoring powershell scripts resume running after restart or power-cycle. At this point, we do not support running the Powershell scripts as a Windows Service ... but using the Windows Task Scheduler, you can do very close to the same thing.

* As Administrator, enter the Task Scheduler (COntrol Panel-> Administrative Tools->Task Scheduler)

* Create Task General
  - Name CopperEggTask
  - When running the task, use the Administrator account.
  - Run whether user is logged in or not
  - Run with Highest Privelages
  - Configure for the OS you are using

* Create Task Trigger
  - Begin the Task On a Schedule
  - Daily
  - set time to current time
  - Recur every 1 day
  Advanced Settings:
  - Repeat task every 5 minutes, for duration Indefinitely
  Check the Enabled box. Other boxes cleared.

* Create Task Actions
  - Start a Program
  Program     C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
  Arguments   -noexit -File "C:\Program Files (x86)\CopperEgg\Modules\CopperEgg\CopperEggTask.ps1"
  Options field blank

  NOTE: You can select the 32 or 64 bit powershell executable. Above the 64 bit is specified.

* Create Task Conditions
  - Leave all boxes cleared

* Create Task Settings
  - Check Allow Task to be run on demand, Run task as soon as possible after scheduled start is missed, and if the task fails, restart every 1 minute
  - Attempt to restart up to 3 times.
  - Leave the remaining boxes un-checked.
  - If the task is already running,

Close the Task Scheduler. CopperEggTask.ps1 should start (if not already started) within 5 minutes.
